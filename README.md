Week 1 Test Repo
Source control (also known as version control) offers several key benefits for developers, teams, and projects of all sizes. Here are the main advantages:

1. Version History
Every change to the codebase is tracked.

You can view or revert to previous versions if something breaks.

Useful for auditing and debugging purposes.

2. Collaboration
Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes.

Tools like Git allow for branching and merging, so features or bug fixes can be developed in isolation.

3. Backup
The repository acts as a backup, especially when hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Reduces risk of code loss due to hardware failure or accidental deletions.

4. Branching and Merging
Developers can create separate branches for features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

Merges can bring changes together safely after testing.

5. Accountability and Blame Tracking
You can see who made what changes and why (with commit messages).

Helps in code reviews, debugging, and understanding project history.

6. Continuous Integration/Deployment Support
Source control integrates with CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated builds, tests, and deployments.

Enhances software quality and speeds up delivery.

7. Experimentation Without Risk
Developers can try new ideas in branches without endangering stable code.

Easier to test and discard or adopt changes.

8. Team Productivity
Helps avoid conflicts, reduces redundant work, and improves communication.

Encourages disciplined, modular, and maintainable development practices.
